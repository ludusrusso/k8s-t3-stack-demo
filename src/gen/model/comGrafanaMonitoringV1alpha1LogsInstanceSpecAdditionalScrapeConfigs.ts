/**
* AdditionalScrapeConfigs allows specifying a key of a Secret containing additional Grafana Agent logging scrape configurations. Scrape configurations specified are appended to the configurations generated by the Grafana Agent Operator.   Job configurations specified must have the form as specified in the official Promtail documentation:   https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/configuration/#scrape_configs   As scrape configs are appended, the user is responsible to make sure it is valid. Note that using this feature may expose the possibility to break upgrades of Grafana Agent. It is advised to review both Grafana Agent and Promtail release notes to ensure that no incompatible scrape configs are going to break Grafana Agent after the upgrade.
