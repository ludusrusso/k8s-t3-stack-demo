/**
* ParentRef identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered a parent of this resource (usually a route). The only kind of parent resource with \"Core\" support is Gateway. This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent resources, such as HTTPRoute.   The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.   References to objects with invalid Group and Kind are not valid, and must be rejected by the implementation, with appropriate Conditions set on the containing object.
