The final number of instances created from the template will be equal to: - If expressed as a fixed number, the minimum of either `targetSize.fixed` or `instanceGroupManager.targetSize` is used. - if expressed as a `percent`, the `targetSize` would be `(targetSize.percent/100 * InstanceGroupManager.targetSize)` If there is a remainder, the number is rounded. If unset, this version will update any remaining instances not updated by another `version`.
