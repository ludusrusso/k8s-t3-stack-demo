* If source service accounts are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this list. Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an instance\'s external IP address because service accounts are associated with an instance, not an IP address. sourceRanges can be set at the same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP belongs to an instance with service account listed in sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as sourceTags or targetTags.
